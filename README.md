### Project Title : Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO).
The dataset was released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment
Outcome 2015 (AMEO). The study is primarily limited only to students with engineering
disciplines. The dataset contains the employment outcomes of engineering graduates as
dependent variables (Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations) along with the standardized
scores from three different areas â€“ cognitive skills, technical skills and personality skills.
The dataset also contains demographic features. The dataset contains around 40
independent variables and 4000 data points. The independent variables are both
continuous and categorical in nature. The dataset contains a unique identifier for each
candidate. Below mentioned table contains the details for the original dataset

## Step 1: Importing Data and Initial Exploration
- Import the data.
- Display the head, shape, and description of the data.

## Step 2: Univariate Analysis
### PDFs, Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots, etc.
  outliers in each numerical column.
- the frequency distribution of each categorical variable/column.
-

## Step 3: Bivariate Analysis
### Relationships Between Numerical Columns
- Used scatter plots, hexbin plots, pair plots, etc., to discover relationships.
### Patterns Between Categorical and Numerical Columns
- Used swarm plots, box plots, bar plots, etc., to identify patterns.
### Relationships Between Categorical Columns
- Used stacked bar plots to identify relationships.


## Step 4: Research Questions
1. **Times of India Article Analysis**
   - Test the claim regarding earnings after Computer Science Engineering.
2. **Gender and Specialization Relationship**
   - Investigate if the preference of specialization depends on gender.
## Conclusion
The claim that fresh graduates in specific job roles can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs is not supported by the data. The average salary in the dataset exceeds this claimed range.
The simulation under the null hypothesis suggests that the observed average salary is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance under the claimed salary range
Visualizing the rejection region on the sample salary distribution indicates that salaries beyond a certain threshold are considered statistically significant, implying that they differ from the claimed range.
Industry Trends and Job Demand: Certain industries or sectors may offer higher salaries and job demand compared to others. Understanding the skills and qualifications valued in these industries could provide insights for career planning and development.
Personality Traits and Career Success: Personality traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience may influence career success and salary levels. Analyzing these traits in relation to job performance and satisfaction could provide valuable insights.
